Android specific GStreamer plugin

droidcamsrc: A camera source. Wrapper around Android camera HAL
droideglsink: A GStreamer sink for rendering
droidenc and droiddec: Custom OpenMAX IL wrapper utilizing Android specific extensions.

The code is far from perfect.
droidenc and droiddec are an awful mess. It's a miracle that they work.
